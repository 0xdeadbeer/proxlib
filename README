    Proxy C library for HTTP/s protocol 

    NOTE: I have yet to turn this piece of clutter into a library.

TECHNICALS 

    * Parsing is carried by a dedicated sub-library which I wrote named parslib.
    * Mass string comparisons are carried by another dedicated sub-library which
    I wrote named streecmp. It runs in O(n) time. n being the lenght of the string - 
    no matter the amount of strings you want to compare it against (I am indeed 
    aware it is nonetheless worse than hashtables - maybe one day I will implement 
    those on my own as well).
    * After the connection is established with the upstream server, a relay loop 
    is started in which the client data is relayed to the server's socket and 
    server data is relayed to client's socket. This is highly inspired from 
    tinyproxy.

COMMITS
    
    Each commit is prefixed with an indicator token of what the change is
    *mostly* about. List of tokens is: 
    
        * init: change initialized the repository
        * repo: change is about the repository in general
