TECHNICALS 

    * Parsing is carried by a dedicated sub-library which I wrote named parslib.
    * Mass string comparisons are carried by another dedicated sub-library which
    I wrote named streecmp. It runs in O(n) time. n being the lenght of the string - 
    no matter the amount of strings you want to compare it against (I am indeed 
    aware it is nonetheless worse than hashtables - maybe one day I will implement 
    those on my own as well).
    * After the connection is established with the upstream server, a relay loop 
    is started in which the client data is relayed to the server's socket and 
    server data is relayed to client's socket. This is highly inspired from 
    tinyproxy.
    * HTTPs is achieved through CONNECT tunelling

COMMITS
    
    Each commit is prefixed with an indicator token of what the change is
    *mostly* about. List of tokens is: 
    
        * init: change initialized the repository
        * repo: change is about the repository in general
        * proxy: change is about the proxy in general
        * logic: change is about proxy logic - parsing, forwarding, ...
        * fix: change is about fixing a bug or TODO
